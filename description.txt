The Bottine Mod is a mod that adds a new bar (and stuff to craft using it).

Content:
 - a mighty metal, called Lolitium, which can be crafted with lunar materials...
 - a new weapon,  the Royal Wyvern spear.
 - an armor set, the Royal Wyvern armor.
 
Future content:
 - generated Lolitium ore in a new world.
 - a king mimic boss (when I get better at coding).
 - more WEAPONS.

I will add more content the better I get with C#, but for now I will mostly focus on learning.

Enjoy
