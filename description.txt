The Bottine Mod is a mod that adds a new endgame ore (and stuff to craft using it).

I AM CURRENTLY LOOKING FOR SPRITERS (AND CODERS), PLEASE PM ME ON THE FORUM IF YOU ARE INTERESTED!

Content:
 - a mighty endgame ore, Lolitium! (don't take the name too seriously)
 - a new weapon,  the Royal Wyvern spear.
 - an armor set, the Royal Wyvern armor.
 
Future content:
 - a fair share of bosses, mainly dragons/true wyverns (when I get better at coding).
 - new enemies, most of them will draw inspiration from Mabinogi.
 - more WEAPONS.

I will add more content the better I get with C#, but for now I will mostly focus on learning.

Enjoy
