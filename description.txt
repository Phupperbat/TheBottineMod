The Bottine Mod is a mod that adds a new endgame ore (and stuff to craft using it), along with a lottery item that can be crafted with 1 gold coin.

I AM CURRENTLY LOOKING FOR SPRITERS, PLEASE PM ME ON THE FORUM IF YOU ARE INTERESTED!

Content:
 - a mighty endgame ore, Lolitium! (don't take the name too seriously)
 - a new weapon,  the Royal Wyvern spear.
 - an armor set, the Royal Wyvern armor.
 - lottery ticket item.
 
Future content:
 - a fair share of bosses, mainly dragons/true wyverns (when I get better at coding).
 - new enemies, most of them will draw inspiration from Mabinogi.
 - more WEAPONS.

Enjoy
