The Bottine Mod is a mod that... adds a spear (and an armor).

Content:
 - 1 new weapon, the Royal Wyvern spear, which is crafted by using various endgame materials (this will change soon enough)
 - an armor set, the Royal Wyvern armor.
 
Future content:
 - a new ore called Lolitium (totally not suspicious)
 - a boss, the King Mimic.

I will add more content the better I get with C#, but for now I will mostly focus on learning.

Enjoy
